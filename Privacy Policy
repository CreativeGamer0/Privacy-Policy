Privacy Policy
Last updated: September 19, 2023

Scope of Privacy Policy
This Privacy Policy pertains to the collection of information, including contact details, by Hexabit Labs concerning you. We urge you to carefully review this Privacy Policy.

Information Gathering and Its Purpose
Information directly provided to Hexabit Labs: When you download an app from Hexabit Labs, there is no obligation to disclose personal information about yourself. However, our games may request various types of information when you register for specific services, access certain content or features, or directly engage with our services. This information may include:

- Contact information such as your name, email address, and age.

Our primary objectives in gathering and utilizing this information are to offer and enhance our services, assist you in managing your account on our services, and provide you with an improved service experience.

In certain cases, we may collect payment and identity verification details, such as credit card numbers (if necessary for payment), to complete specific transactions or access particular services (e.g., in-app purchases).

Information automatically collected on Hexabit Labs includes:

- Your device type and settings, software used, browser type, and operating system.
- Your Internet Protocol (IP) address, which is automatically assigned to your device when you connect to the internet and may sometimes be used to determine your general geographic location.
- Web pages and advertisements viewed, as well as links clicked within Hexabit Labs.
- Unique identifiers and connection information, including mobile device identification numbers (e.g., Apple's Identifier for Advertising IP [IDFA] or Google's Android Advertising ID [AAID]) and internet connection details (e.g., mobile operator, ISP, Wi-Fi connection) that may identify the physical location of such devices in compliance with applicable laws.
- Information collected through cookies, web beacons, and similar technologies, including standard server log information.

Third-Party Advertisements
We may employ third-party advertising companies to display ads on our service. However, we do not provide personal information to third-party advertising companies on an individual basis. Our system, along with third-party advertising technology, may use aggregated information, non-personal information, Hexabit Labs cookies stored on your device, and your use of the service to target advertisements. Furthermore, advertisers may use other third-party advertising technology to target ads on other websites. If you are served advertisements, a unique third-party cookie or cookies may be placed on your device. Similarly, third-party advertising companies may provide us with pixel tags (also known as "clear gifs" or "beacons") to help manage and optimize online advertising. Beacons enable us to identify a browser cookie when a browser visits the site containing the beacon and to determine which banner ads bring users to a particular site.

Your Rights
We take reasonable measures to safeguard your personal information to prevent loss, misuse, unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction. We adhere to generally accepted standards for safeguarding personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and upon receipt. However, please be aware that no method of internet transmission or electronic storage is entirely secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute security.

Protection of Information
We are committed to safeguarding your information and have implemented commercially reasonable technical, administrative, and physical measures to help protect it from loss, misuse, unauthorized access, and alteration. It's important to note that no data transmission or storage can be guaranteed to be 100% secure.

Privacy Protections for Children
Our game services are not designed for children. They are intended for a general audience and do not knowingly collect or store contact information about individuals under the age of 13. We may request your age to ensure that we are not collecting information from individuals under 13 years of age or to identify when additional measures may be necessary if information has been collected from individuals under 18. In cases where a Hexabit Labs service has actual knowledge of collecting information from children or providing a service directed at children as defined by applicable laws, we will comply with those laws.

Changes to Our Privacy Policy
We may revise this Privacy Policy to reflect changes in our practices and service offerings. If we make modifications to our Privacy Policy, we will update the "last modified" date, and such changes will become effective upon posting.

Contact & Inquiries
Should you have any questions regarding this Privacy Policy, please don't hesitate to get in touch with us, and we will strive to respond to your request within a reasonable timeframe. You can also submit questions or comments using the email address provided below.
